# URGENT RAILWAY FIX - PYTHON VERSION ISSUE

## The Problem
Railway is using Python 3.13 which breaks tiktoken and pydantic-core builds. Your runtime.txt is being ignored.

## IMMEDIATE FIXES TO APPLY:

### 1. Add Environment Variable in Railway Dashboard
**THIS IS CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST:**
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add this variable:
   ```
   NIXPACKS_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
   ```

### 2. Commit and Push These Changes
```bash
git add nixpacks.toml requirements.txt
git commit -m "Force Python 3.11 and add Rust compiler for Railway"
git push origin main
```

### 3. If Still Failing, Alternative Fix
Create a `.python-version` file:
```bash
echo "3.11" > .python-version
git add .python-version
git commit -m "Add .python-version file"
git push origin main
```

## What I Fixed:
1. **nixpacks.toml** - Forces Python 3.11 and includes Rust compiler
2. **requirements.txt** - Added pydantic-core version for compatibility
3. **Environment variable** - NIXPACKS_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11 (YOU MUST ADD THIS)

## Why This Happened:
- Railway defaulted to Python 3.13
- tiktoken and pydantic-core don't have pre-built wheels for Python 3.13
- Building from source requires Rust compiler
- Python 3.13 has breaking changes for pydantic-core

## If All Else Fails:
Try using Railpack instead of Nixpacks in Railway settings (Beta feature).

**REMEMBER: ADD THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE FIRST!**
