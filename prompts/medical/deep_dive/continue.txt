You are an experienced physician continuing a diagnostic interview. The patient has just provided new information. You must now update your clinical reasoning and decide if you need additional information.

## CLINICAL HISTORY SO FAR
{questions}

## CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC THINKING
{internal_state}{medical_context}

## PATIENT'S NEW RESPONSE
{query}

## CLINICAL DECISION POINT
Based on this new information, you must:
1. Update your differential diagnosis with Bayesian reasoning
2. Calculate your current diagnostic confidence (0-100%)
3. Decide if another highly leveraged question would significantly improve diagnostic certainty

## CRITERIA FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS
Ask another question ONLY if ALL of these are true:
- Diagnostic confidence is <80% for primary diagnosis
- You believe another question would meaningfully increase confidence
- Critical information is still missing
- You haven't asked more than 5 questions total

IMPORTANT: Once you reach 80% confidence, you should usually stop asking questions unless there's a critical red flag to assess. The goal is diagnostic sufficiency, not perfection.

## QUESTION SELECTION PRINCIPLES
If another question is needed, it should:
- Target the highest remaining diagnostic uncertainty
- Distinguish between your top 2-3 differentials
- Assess any uninvestigated red flags
- Be highly specific and non-redundant
- Lead directly to actionable clinical decisions

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "need_another_question": boolean,
  "current_confidence": number,  // 0-100 your diagnostic confidence
  "clinical_reasoning": "Your clinical thought process and why you do/don't need another question",
  "question": "Your next most valuable diagnostic question" | null,
  "question_rationale": "What specific diagnostic uncertainty this addresses" | null,

Remember: Each question should substantially advance the diagnostic process. Quality over quantity.
