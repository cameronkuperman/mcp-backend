# ðŸš€ Background Jobs Implementation - FAANG Level

## âœ… Implementation Complete

All background health intelligence generation jobs have been successfully implemented with enterprise-grade features.

## ðŸ“… Weekly Job Schedule

Jobs are strategically distributed across the week to prevent system overload:

| Day | Time (UTC) | Job | Description |
|-----|------------|-----|-------------|
| **Monday** | 2:00 AM | Health Stories | Generates comprehensive weekly health narratives |
| **Tuesday** | 2:00 AM | AI Predictions | Immediate, seasonal, long-term predictions + patterns |
| **Wednesday** | 2:00 AM | Health Insights | Positive, warning, and neutral insights |
| **Thursday** | 2:00 AM | Shadow Patterns | Detects missing health patterns |
| **Friday** | 2:00 AM | Strategic Moves | Actionable health strategies |
| **Saturday** | 2:00 AM | Health Scores | Weekly score calculation + cleanup |
| **Hourly** | :00 | Prediction Check | Checks user preferences for custom timing |
| **Daily** | 3:00 AM | Cleanup | Removes expired share links |
| **Sunday** | Midnight | Reset Limits | Resets weekly refresh limits |

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Batch Processing**
- Processes users in batches of 10
- 5-second delay between batches
- Prevents system overload
- Concurrent processing within batches

### 2. **Error Handling & Retries**
- Exponential backoff (10s, 20s, 40s)
- Model fallback chain for 429 errors
- Per-user error isolation
- Automatic retry queue

### 3. **Model Fallback Chain**
```python
1. openai/gpt-5-mini (primary)
2. google/gemini-2.5-pro 
3. deepseek/deepseek-chat
4. google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free
5. meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct:free
```

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- Redis caching (when available)
- Concurrent user processing
- Smart duplicate detection
- Week-based data partitioning

## ðŸ”§ Fixed Issues

1. âœ… **regenerate_expired_predictions** - Replaced RPC with direct queries
2. âœ… **NoneType error** - Added robust null checking in data_gathering.py
3. âœ… **get_users_due_for_generation** - Refactored to use direct table queries
4. âœ… **Job scheduling** - Distributed across week to prevent overload

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

All tests passed successfully:
- âœ… User Retrieval (41 users found)
- âœ… Batch Processor 
- âœ… Redis Connection
- âœ… Job Scheduling
- âœ… Single User Generation

## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

The system will automatically use the new enhanced background jobs (`background_jobs_v2.py`) when you restart the server:

```bash
python run_oracle.py
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring

Jobs log execution details including:
- Total users processed
- Success/failure counts
- Processing time
- Error details

Check server logs for job execution status.

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

1. **Every scheduled time**: Job triggers automatically
2. **Gets all users**: Fetches from medical table
3. **Batch processing**: Processes 10 users at a time
4. **Error handling**: Retries failed users with backoff
5. **Logging**: Records results for monitoring

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

Your health intelligence system now automatically generates:
- Weekly health stories
- AI predictions (all types)
- Health insights
- Shadow patterns
- Strategic moves
- Health scores

For ALL users, every week, with enterprise-grade reliability!
