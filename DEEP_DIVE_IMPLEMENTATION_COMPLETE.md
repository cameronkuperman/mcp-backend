# âœ… Deep Dive Enhancements - Implementation Complete

## Summary
All requested deep dive enhancements have been successfully implemented. The code compiles without errors and is ready for deployment.

## What Was Implemented

### âœ… Core Features
- **7 Question Limit**: Deep dives now stop at maximum 7 questions
- **90% Confidence Target**: Automatically completes when 90% confidence is reached
- **Question Deduplication**: Prevents asking similar questions (>80% similarity)
- **Smart Completion**: Completes early if good confidence achieved (85% at 5+ questions)
- **Session Tracking**: Stores all previous questions and answers

### âœ… New Endpoints
1. **`POST /api/deep-dive/think-harder`**
   - Re-analyzes with o4-mini-high model
   - Provides enhanced reasoning chain
   - Improves diagnostic confidence

2. **`POST /api/deep-dive/ask-more`**
   - Generates additional targeted questions
   - Respects global 7 question limit
   - Avoids duplicate questions

3. **`POST /api/quick-scan/think-harder`**
   - Enhanced analysis with GPT-4
   - Detailed differential diagnosis
   - Treatment recommendations

4. **`POST /api/quick-scan/ask-more`**
   - Follow-up questions for quick scans
   - Limited to 3 questions
   - 90% confidence target

## Files Modified
- âœ… `/api/health_scan.py` - All endpoints implemented
- âœ… `/models/requests.py` - All request models added
- âœ… `/run_oracle.py` - Already includes health_scan router

## Database Updates Required
Run the SQL commands in `deep_dive_enhancements.md` to update your database schema.

## Frontend Tasks
1. Add "Think Harder" button on completed analyses
2. Add "Ask More Questions" button when confidence < 90%
3. Show question progress (e.g., "Question 3 of 7")
4. Display confidence meter targeting 90%
5. Handle automatic completion responses

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Deploy backend with new endpoints
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Test deep dive stops at 7 questions
- [ ] Test deep dive completes at 90% confidence
- [ ] Test duplicate questions are avoided
- [ ] Test think-harder improves confidence
- [ ] Test ask-more generates good questions

## Next Steps
1. Run database migrations (SQL in deep_dive_enhancements.md)
2. Deploy backend to Railway
3. Update frontend to use new endpoints
4. Test complete flow end-to-end

All implementation is complete and ready for deployment! ðŸš€
