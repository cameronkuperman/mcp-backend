Symptoms include nasal obstruction and irritation. Treatment options discussed: nasal corticosteroid sprays (e.g., fluticasone), oral corticosteroids for severe cases, antihistamines, and biologic medications (e.g., dupilumab). Lifestyle measures include saline nasal irrigation, humidifier use, and avoiding irritants. Surgical intervention (endoscopic sinus surgery) may be considered if polyps persist. Recommended consultation with an ENT specialist for tailored management.
