## 🔋 Energy & Fatigue - Clinical Reasoning

### Why These Questions Matter

Energy and fatigue complaints are among the most common in primary care but also the most diagnostically challenging. They can represent everything from simple sleep debt to serious systemic disease.

### Question Rationale

#### **Fatigue Severity** - Primary Differentiator
- **Normal tired vs Pathological fatigue**: This immediately separates lifestyle issues from medical conditions
- **"Exhausted even after sleeping"** → Points to sleep disorders (apnea), metabolic issues (thyroid, diabetes), or chronic fatigue syndrome
- **"Sudden crashes"** → Suggests adrenal issues, post-exertional malaise (CFS/ME hallmark), or blood sugar problems
- **"Constant drain"** → Indicates chronic conditions: anemia, cancer, autoimmune disease

#### **Activity Capacity** - Functional Assessment
- **Percentage-based measurement** provides objective disability assessment
- **<25% capacity** → Severe impairment requiring urgent evaluation
- **25-50%** → Moderate disease burden, likely systemic condition
- **50-75%** → Mild-moderate, could be early disease or deconditioning
- Used for disability documentation and treatment response monitoring

#### **Associated Symptoms** - Pattern Recognition
- **Muscle weakness + fatigue** → Neuromuscular diseases, myasthenia gravis
- **Brain fog + unrefreshing sleep** → Classic CFS/ME or fibromyalgia
- **Body aches + fatigue** → Viral, autoimmune, or fibromyalgia
- Combination patterns help narrow differential quickly

### Red Flag Patterns
- Fatigue + unintended weight loss → Cancer screening needed
- Fatigue + night sweats → Lymphoma, TB, HIV screening
- Sudden severe fatigue in elderly → Cardiac evaluation

## 🧠 Mental Health - Clinical Reasoning

### Why These Questions Matter

Mental health presentations often involve stigma and reluctance to disclose. Questions must be non-threatening while capturing DSM-5 criteria and functional impact.

### Question Rationale

#### **Main Difficulty** - Functional Domains
Maps directly to DSM-5 symptom clusters:
- **Energy/motivation** → Major depression cardinal symptom
- **Mood/emotions** → Mood disorder spectrum
- **Worry/thoughts** → Anxiety disorders, OCD, psychosis screening
- **Sleep/appetite** → Neurovegetative symptoms (depression severity marker)
- **Memory/concentration** → Cognitive symptoms (severe depression, ADHD, dementia)
- **Physical symptoms** → Somatization, panic disorder
- **Relationships** → Social impact (all disorders)

#### **Symptom Description** - Unstructured Insight
- Free text reveals thought organization (or disorganization)
- Language patterns indicate severity (hopelessness phrases)
- Helps identify suicidal ideation without direct questioning
- Shows insight level (awareness of problem)

#### **Duration Pattern** - Diagnostic Criteria
- **Days** → Adjustment disorder, acute stress
- **Weeks** → Major depressive episode (2+ weeks required)
- **Months** → Persistent depressive disorder
- **Years** → Personality factors, chronic conditions
- **Episodic** → Bipolar screening critical

### Red Flag Patterns
- New onset in elderly → Medical cause likely (thyroid, B12, dementia)
- Sudden personality change → Brain tumor, infection
- Physical symptoms prominent → Medical workup needed

- **Slow (weeks+)** → Chronic infections (TB), malignancy

#### **Main Symptoms** - Syndrome Recognition
Combinations identify specific syndromes:
- **Fever + cough + body aches** → Influenza-like illness
- **Sore throat + fever without cough** → Streptococcal pharyngitis
- **Stomach issues + fever** → Gastroenteritis
- **Headache + fever + neck stiffness** → Meningitis concern

#### **Severity Progression** - Treatment Urgency
- **Worse quickly** → Bacterial infection, sepsis risk
- **Improving** → Viral, self-limited
- **Fluctuating** → Malaria pattern, complex infection

#### **Risk Factors** - Exposure History
- **Travel** → Exotic infections, COVID variants
- **Sick contacts** → Contagious period assessment

## 💊 Medication Side Effects - Clinical Reasoning

### Why These Questions Matter

Medication side effects account for significant morbidity. Distinguishing true side effects from disease symptoms guides whether to continue, adjust, or stop medications.

### Question Rationale

#### **Which Medications** - Temporal Relationship
- **New medication (<1 month)** → Most side effects occur early
- **Dose change** → Dose-dependent toxicity
- **Long-term** → Cumulative effects (kidney, liver)

- **Stomach** → NSAIDs, antibiotics, metformin
- **Dizziness** → Blood pressure meds, benzos, antihistamines
- **Mood/sleep** → Steroids, beta-blockers, stimulants
- **Sexual** → SSRIs, blood pressure meds
Helps identify culprit medication in polypharmacy

#### **Effect on Life** - Management Decision
- **Tolerable** → Continue with monitoring
- **Affecting daily** → Dose adjustment, timing change
- **Unbearable** → Medication change needed
- **Dangerous** → Immediate discontinuation

### Red Flag Patterns
- Rash + fever + medication → Stevens-Johnson syndrome
- Muscle pain + statins → Rhabdomyolysis risk
- Confusion + elderly + new medication → Delirium

## 🔄 Multiple Issues - Clinical Reasoning

### Why These Questions Matter

Multiple complaints can represent one systemic disease or several conditions. Proper questioning identifies patterns suggesting unified diagnosis versus multiple problems.

### Question Rationale

#### **Symptom Timeline** - Diagnostic Unity
- **Simultaneous onset** → Single cause likely (infection, autoimmune flare)
- **Sequential** → Primary condition with complications or separate issues

#### **Symptom Order** - Primary vs Secondary
- First symptom often the primary driver
- Cascade pattern (pain → poor sleep → fatigue) guides treatment priority
- Helps identify medication cascades

#### **Systems Involved** - Pattern Recognition
- **Energy + joints** → Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus
- **Gut + skin + joints** → Inflammatory bowel disease
- **Everything hurts** → Fibromyalgia
- **Neuro + fatigue** → Multiple sclerosis

### Red Flag Patterns
- Multiple systems + weight loss → Malignancy
- Multiple systems + fever → Systemic infection, autoimmune
- New multiple complaints in elderly → Depression, malignancy

## ❓ Unsure - Clinical Reasoning

### Why These Questions Matter

Vague symptoms are often early presentations of serious disease or somatic manifestations of psychological distress. These questions tease out objective findings.

### Question Rationale

#### **Functional Trigger** - Objective vs Subjective
- **Others noticed** → Objective change, higher concern
- **Can't do activities** → Functional impairment, measurable
- **Worried** → Anxiety component, but don't dismiss
- **Prevent worsening** → Health-conscious, good prognosis

#### **Subtle Changes** - Early Detection
- **Need stimulants** → Fatigue, depression, thyroid
- **Clothes fit differently** → Weight change, edema, muscle loss
- **People asking** → Visible changes patient doesn't recognize
- **Forgetful** → Cognitive decline, B12, thyroid

### Red Flag Patterns
- Personality change noticed by others → Brain pathology
- Weight loss without trying → Malignancy, hyperthyroid
- Progressive functional decline → Neurodegenerative

- **Constant** → Inflammatory (arthritis) or tumor
- **Worse at rest/night** → Inflammatory or neoplastic (classic red flag)
- **Waves/attacks** → Visceral or vascular

#### **Red Flag Screen** - Emergency Triage
Critical for identifying surgical emergencies:
- **Bladder/bowel loss** → Cauda equina syndrome (surgical emergency)
- **Groin numbness** → Saddle anesthesia (cord compression)
- **Fever + back pain** → Spinal infection/abscess
- **Night pain** → Tumor (primary or metastatic)

#### **What Helped** - Treatment Clues
- **Rest helps** → Mechanical/overuse
- **Movement helps** → Inflammatory (morning stiffness)

2. **Red Flag Priority**: Any red flag response triggers urgent care recommendation

3. **Confidence Scoring**: 
   - High confidence: Classic pattern with multiple supporting features
   - Medium confidence: Some supporting features but incomplete picture
   - Low confidence: Vague or contradictory responses

4. **Follow-up Generation**: AI should generate follow-up questions targeting:
   - Missing red flag screens
   - Clarification of ambiguous responses
   - Confirmation of suspected patterns

5. **Recommendation Hierarchy**:
   - Emergency: Red flags present
   - Urgent: Progressive symptoms, moderate functional impairment
   - Routine: Stable symptoms, minimal impairment
   - Self-care: Clear benign pattern, improving symptoms
