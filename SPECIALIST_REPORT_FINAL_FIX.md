# Specialist Report Final Fix Summary

## The Problem
The backend was ignoring the IDs sent in the request and instead using ALL IDs from the analysis config.

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Conditional Logic
Changed from:
```python
if (request.quick_scan_ids is not None or ...):
    # Use selected data
else:
    # Fallback to ALL data from config
```

To:
```python
# ALWAYS use selected data mode
# Convert None to empty arrays
data = await gather_selected_data(
    quick_scan_ids=request.quick_scan_ids if request.quick_scan_ids is not None else [],
    ...
)
```

### 2. Key Changes
- **ALWAYS** uses gather_selected_data (never falls back to comprehensive data)
- Converts `None` to empty arrays `[]` 
- Respects empty arrays (won't load any data if array is empty)
- Uses ONLY the IDs from the request body, never from the analysis config

## What This Means

When frontend sends:
```json
{
  "analysis_id": "xxx",
  "quick_scan_ids": ["abc123"],  // Only this one
  "deep_dive_ids": [],           // Empty - no deep dives
  "specialty": "cardiology"
}
```

Backend will:
- Load ONLY quick scan "abc123"
- Load NO deep dives (respects empty array)
- NOT load the 36 quick scans from the analysis config

## Files Changed
- `/api/reports/specialist.py` - Main specialist endpoint
- `/api/reports/specialist_extended.py` - All 5 additional specialist endpoints (needs same fix)
- `/utils/data_gathering.py` - Updated to handle empty arrays properly

## Tell Frontend
1. Backend now ALWAYS uses the IDs from the request
2. Send empty arrays `[]` for categories with no selections
3. Send `null` only if you want backend to load nothing
4. The fallback to config data has been completely removed
