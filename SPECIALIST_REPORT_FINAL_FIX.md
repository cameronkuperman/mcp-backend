# Specialist Report Final Fix Summary

## The Problem
The backend was ignoring the IDs sent in the request and instead using ALL IDs from the analysis config.

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Conditional Logic
Changed from:
```python
if (request.quick_scan_ids is not None or ...):
    # Use selected data
else:
    # Fallback to ALL data from config
```

To:
```python
# ALWAYS use selected data mode
# Convert None to empty arrays
data = await gather_selected_data(
    quick_scan_ids=request.quick_scan_ids if request.quick_scan_ids is not None else [],
    ...
)
```

### 2. Key Changes
- **ALWAYS** uses gather_selected_data (never falls back to comprehensive data)
- Converts `None` to empty arrays `[]` 
- Respects empty arrays (won't load any data if array is empty)
- Uses ONLY the IDs from the request body, never from the analysis config

## What This Means

When frontend sends:
```json
{
  "analysis_id": "xxx",
  "quick_scan_ids": ["abc123"],  // Only this one
  "deep_dive_ids": [],           // Empty - no deep dives
  "specialty": "cardiology"
}
```

Backend will:
- Load ONLY quick scan "abc123"
- Load NO deep dives (respects empty array)
- NOT load the 36 quick scans from the analysis config

## Files Changed
- `/api/reports/specialist.py` - Main specialist endpoint ✓
- `/api/reports/specialist_extended.py` - All 5 additional specialist endpoints ✓
  - nephrology
  - urology  
  - gynecology
  - oncology
  - physical-therapy
- `/utils/data_gathering.py` - Updated to handle empty arrays properly ✓

## Tell Frontend
1. Backend now ALWAYS uses the IDs from the request
2. Send empty arrays `[]` for categories with no selections
3. Send `null` only if you want backend to load nothing
4. The fallback to config data has been completely removed

## About the 429 Error
The 429 error you saw is a rate limit warning from the LLM provider, but your request actually succeeded (200 OK). The backend handles rate limits by retrying with delays. If responses are coming back quickly, it means the retry worked.

The "createClient is not a function" error is a frontend Supabase import issue, not related to the backend.
